        title: "Founders vision",
        text: "After a long successful career in Ghana and across many parts of Africa with many years of training in leading multi-national firms, I gained an in-depth insight into some of the barriers that impede excellence and breakthrough in Ghana and Africaâ€™s socio-economic challenges such as unemployment, poor health care and low productivity in business and state enterprises. It is on the basis of the foregoing reasons that I nurtured the ambition to establish an institution of higher education that would emphasize excellence in entrepreneurship and leadership in areas of academic pursuit. My objective for WEUC is to produce a pedigree of visionary graduates that will adequately respond to present and future challenges in business, science and Information and Communication technology."
